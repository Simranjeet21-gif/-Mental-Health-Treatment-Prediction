# 🧠-Mental-Health-Treatment-Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment based on their survey responses. The dataset is derived from a mental health survey that contains multiple features such as workplace environment, accessibility of mental health resources, employer support, and personal attitudes toward mental health.

The prediction model is integrated with a Streamlit Web App, which provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input their responses and get real-time predictions about their likelihood of seeking treatment.

The goal of this project is to raise awareness of the factors influencing mental health treatment, demonstrate the power of Machine Learning in healthcare applications, and provide a user-friendly tool to analyze survey-based predictions.

🚀 Key Features

📊 Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing survey insights such as mental health support in the workplace, stigma, and accessibility.

🤖 Machine Learning Model: Implemented AdaBoost Classifier, an ensemble learning technique that improves prediction performance by combining weak learners.

🌐 Streamlit Integration: A clean and interactive interface where users can answer questions and instantly receive prediction results.

📈 Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to evaluate the model’s performance.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Web App: Streamlit

Version Control: Git & GitHub

🔬 Workflow

Dataset Collection – Used the OSMI Mental Health Survey dataset.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Managed missing data, applied encoding for categorical responses, and normalized numerical features.

Feature Selection – Identified key survey factors that influence treatment prediction.

Model Building – Trained an AdaBoost Classifier with hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation – Compared performance metrics and ensured generalization.

Streamlit App Development – Designed an interactive app for real-time predictions.

📊 Results & Insights

The AdaBoost model achieved strong performance in predicting treatment likelihood.

Workplace-related factors (like employer support, availability of mental health benefits, and culture around mental health discussions) showed significant influence.

The interactive app provides a clear visualization of predictions, making it easier to understand how inputs affect outcomes.

🎯 Future Improvements

Integrate additional datasets to improve generalization.

Deploy the app on a cloud platform (Heroku, Streamlit Cloud, or AWS).

Add explainable AI techniques (like SHAP values) to show feature importance for individual predictions.

Enhance the UI/UX with more visualizations and analytics dashboards.
